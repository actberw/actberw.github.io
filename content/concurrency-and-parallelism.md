Concurrency is about structure, parallelism is about execution. 
Concurrency is a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently.
Communication is the means to coordinate the independent executions(CSP: Communicating Sequential Processes).

Concurrency provides a way to structure a solution to solve a problem that may (but not necessarily) be parallelizable.
