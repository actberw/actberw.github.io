Is Linux so great that there is no fragmentation of the data? FALSE. Linux is great (that’s true) but even in your wildest dreams, there is no way to completely eradicate a disk fragmentation. I see you coming there: “I never defragmented my Linux system, in fact I never saw a tool for that, and my computer has never shown any problem. Are you sure you know what you are talking about?” Well, you are right. In principle, you do not have to defragment your disk on Linux. Data can be fragmented, but in theory you do not have to worry about it, and here’s why.

You can measure the fragmentation of a Linux file system with the fsck command — look for “non-contiguous inodes” in the output.
