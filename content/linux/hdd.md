 hard disk drive

 The first Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) disc drive was introduced in 1983, and the SCSI standard was ratified by American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986. In the years since then, this basic protocol has not changed significantly. There have been massive changes in the physical interface between storage devices and host computers from wide SCSI to fast SCSI to Fibre Channel SCSI (FCP) to Serial Attached SCSI (SAS). The initial interface speed in 1983 was 5 MB/s. Today, interface speeds can reach up to 320 MB/s.



 For years the parallel interface has been widely used in storage systems. The need for increased bandwidth and flexibility in storage systems made the SCSI and ATA standards an inefficient option. A parallel interface is a channel capable of transferring date in parallel mode — that is transmitting multiple bits simultaneously. Almost all personal computers come with at least one parallel interface. Common parallel interfaces include SCSI and ATA.


 ATA stand for Advanced Technology Attachment

 SCSI -> SAS

 PATA(IDE) -> SATA

 HDDs are accessed over one of a number of bus types, including as of 2011 parallel ATA (PATA, also called IDE or EIDE; described before the introduction of SATA as ATA), Serial ATA (SATA), SCSI, Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), and Fibre Channel.
