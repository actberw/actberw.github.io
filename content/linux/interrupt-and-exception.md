Synchronous interrupts are produced by the CPU control unit while executing
instructions and are called synchronous because the control unit issues them
only after terminating the execution of an instruction.

Asynchronous interrupts are generated by other hardware devices at arbitrary
times with respect to the CPU clock signals.

Intel microprocessor manuals designate synchronous and asynchronous interrupts
as exceptions and interrupts, respectively.
