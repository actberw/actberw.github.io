    <p>Up to Python 2.1 the concept of class was unrelated to the concept of type, and old-style classes were the only flavor available. For an old-style class, the statement x.<strong>class</strong> provides the class of x, but type(x) is always &lt;type 'instance'>. This reflects the fact that all old-style instances, independent of their class, are implemented with a single built-in type, called instance. New-style classes were introduced in Python 2.2 to unify the concepts of class and type. The term type is equivalent to the term class, a new-style class is simply a user-defined type. If x is an instance of a new-style class, then type(x) is typically the same as x.<strong>class</strong> . this post is about new-style class or type.</p>
<h3>object defination</h3>
<p>We define an object by saying it has:
    - Identity
    - A value
    - A type
    - One or more bases</p>
<p>In python, everything is an object.</p>
<h3>object and relationship</h3>
<p>These are the subclass-superclass relationship (a.k.a. specialization or inheritance, "man is an animal", etc.) and the type-instance relationship (a.k.a instantiation, "Joe is a man", etc.). &lt;type 'type'> and &lt;type 'object'> are two primitive objects of the system. If an object is an instance of &lt;type 'type'>, then it is a type, otherwise it is not a type(参见<a href="/posts/python/metaclass.html">python元类</a>). &lt;type 'type'> is an instance of itself and a subclass of &lt;type 'object'>. &lt;type 'object'> is an instance of &lt;type 'type'> and a subclass of no object. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">isinstance</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">object</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">object</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="n">True</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">isinstance</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">type</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">object</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="n">True</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Type objects share the following traits:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">They</span> <span class="n">are</span> <span class="n">used</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">represent</span> <span class="n">abstract</span> <span class="n">data</span> <span class="n">types</span> <span class="n">in</span> <span class="n">programs</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">They</span> <span class="n">can</span> <span class="n">be</span> <span class="n">subclassed</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">They</span> <span class="n">can</span> <span class="n">be</span> <span class="n">instantiated</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">The</span> <span class="n">type</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">any</span> <span class="n">type</span> <span class="n">object</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">type</span> <span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="n">type</span><span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>more built-in types</h3>
<p><img alt="built-in types" src="/img/builtin_types.png" /><br />
solid line means inheritance from, dashed line means an instance of.<br />
If we created a new object by subclassing &lt;type 'type'> it would be in the leftmost space, and would also be both a subclass and instance of &lt;type 'type'></p>
